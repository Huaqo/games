    - **Pong**: Pong is a classic 2D game involving two paddles and a ball. The game requires understanding of basic physics, input handling, and AI programming if you wish to include a single-player mode.

    - **Snake**: Snake is a game where the player controls a growing line that crawls around the screen, collecting food and avoiding collision with itself. This game would teach you about handling input and maintaining game state.

    - **Tetris**: Tetris involves moving and rotating falling blocks to form complete lines. This game will challenge your skills in collision detection, input handling, and game state management.

    - **Minesweeper**: Implementing this classic game will test your skills in grid-based logic and simple GUI design.

    - **Breakout**: Similar to Pong, but with bricks to break and power-ups to collect. This would expand on the physics and collision detection used in Pong, and introduce power-up mechanics.

    - **Space Invaders**: This game requires a lot of sprite manipulation, movement, collision detection, and also handling of user input.

    - **Platformer Game**: A simple 2D platformer game would let you practice physics, collision detection, input handling, and AI.

    - **Sudoku**: Implementing Sudoku in C++ can be a fun way to exercise your logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

    - **Chess**: Building a simple chess engine can be a challenging but rewarding project. This would involve deep logic and possibly even AI.

    - **Roguelike Game**: A simple text-based roguelike would be a good project for understanding game loops, random generation, and more complex user input.
